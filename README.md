## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joshua Burer, a full-time CS student and a part-time fullstack web developer. I've been working mostly with Python and Django, but I also have interest in developing websites and games using web and JavaScript technologies like Node.js and Deno.

```python
def skills(topics):
    """This is a cheesy little thing to fill up some more space in my readme :)"""
    skills = set()
    
    if 'Backend' in topics:
        skills.update({'python', 'django'})
    if 'Frontend' in topics:
        skills.update({'html', 'css', 'javascript', 'react'})
    if 'Learning' in topics:
        skills.update({'node.js', 'deno', 'java'})
        
    return skills
```
